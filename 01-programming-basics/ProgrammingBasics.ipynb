    "* Solving a problem by writing by writing computer code.\n",

    "* Programs are created to implement algorithms. \n",
    "* Algorithms can be represented as pseudocode or a flowchart, and programming is the translation of these into a computer program.\n",
    "* To tell a computer to do something, a program must be written to tell it exactly what to do and how to do it.\n",

    "* Programming languages are designed to be easy for a human to understand and write in. However, a computer cannot run programs written in these languages directly.\n",
    "* Most programming languages have to be translated into machine code before the computer can execute the instructions.\n",

    "* The other function of a code is to simplify things, to give them a structure, to help you build more complex things giving you simpler tools.\n",
    "* Imagine that you don’t have any programming language, the only code that you have is the binary system, it would be impractical to write an entire program , that solves a real problem, using just 0’s and 1’s.\n",

    "* This also means you can share code and programs with other people. Think of all the apps and web sites you've looked at, someone wrote those and decided to share it, for fun, profit or some other reason. \n",
