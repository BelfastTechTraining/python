    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library used for manipulating and analysing 2-Dimensional data tables. In some ways you can think of it as SQL or Excel for python. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can do a lot more than either of those tools, but it's a good way to first consider what it might be useful for. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's just jump right in. It'll be easier to show you what it can do, than explain everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading files\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas natively understands quite a lot of formats including CSV, Excel and HTML. You can see a full list of formats it understands here https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html\n",
    "\n",
