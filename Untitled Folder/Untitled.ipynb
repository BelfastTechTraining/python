    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### What?\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages and modules are used in python to facilitate modular programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: It's much easier to focus on one small part of a problem rather than the whole program at once. You just need to understand how the section you are looking at works rather than the entire code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maintainability: When you break up a problem into many smaller problems, typically each piece of code is logically separated from the others. This means making changes to one module is less likely to impact the operations of the others. Meaning many people can work on a project without effecting each other, it's even possible that you have no idea how the rest of the application works, but can understand the module you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reusability: Smaller pieces of code that do one (or a small number of) thing can easily be reused elsewhere. This allows you to reuse the code in the application, or even outside of the application in other solutions that are being developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scoping: We can resuse variable and function names by using separate namespaces. This means that we have less chance of having name collisions in our application.\n"

    "### How can we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 different types of module that can be used in python, normally when creating your own, it will be the first. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A pure python module\n",
    "2. A C/C++ module that is compiled and loaded at run time. (e.g. numpy)\n",
    "3. A built-in module that is part of the interpretter. (asyncio)\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is abstracted from us when we use them in python. They are all brought in using the same keyword `import`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a pure python module all we need to do is create a file with some python code in it and name it with the `.py` extension."
